            <p>Heading should come inside a section called header. Refer to the html tag called header. While
                users can use divs everywhere, html5 came up with semantic elements for common components found in every web page i.e - header, footer, sidenav, etc.
                It is today's practice to devide webpages into these semantic elements (sections) and add the dynamic content in a tag called main. This
                is to aid screen-readers read webpages for those with vision disabilities. While making webpages fully accessible for all users always requires extra efforts
                it is good to adopt basic practices of accessibility from the beginning. HTML is a mark up language not a programming language. While logically it makes screen-readersto use 
                divs everywhere, divs are heavy elements and does not give screen readers any information about the content inside the divs. Understand the semantic purpose
                behind every tag and use the tag to display contents based on the purpose of the contents.
            </p>
            <p> For ex - p tag is for paragraphs not for headings. Always use h1-h8 elements to set the headings
                in pages, sections, etc. Follow the heirarchy of h1-h8 elements as specified in w3 org documentation.</p>
            <p>When writing html code write it as you would use a mark up language, not programming language.
                Identify the structure of a webpage and divide them in your mind while writing code for it. Understand the layout, spaces, paddings, margins
                and write the code in an organizational manner rather than simply writing code to get the end result.
            </p>
            <p>Headings should never have properties such as width, grid-layout properties, height, etc. Headings give information to users about the content.
                So they cannot be clipped. Additionally giving the right alignment properties becomes tricky when you use width or layout properties on headings.
                Width of inner html elements should be determined by it's parent element so as to make pages properly responsive.
                Hence the container which holds the headings will decide the width and accordingly adjust the child elements.

            <p>In this section I proceeded with creating a container class and set an arbitrary width.
            I used margin auto to align it at the center of the page. This is one of the commonly used
            ways to align divs centrally i.e to set a width and use margin auto. </p>
            <p>While I have set a width for this container, it is generally better that the containers be flexible and take spaces based on the screen size
                for making pages responsive in a basic manner. To make pages responsive for all classes of devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) always takes extra effort
                and testing. But it is good to add basic responsive properties to pages so that it supports at the very least small desktop screens.
            </p>
            <p>Setting widths for containers is appropriate for fixed elements such as sidenav, header, footer or containers of grids.</p>
            <p>The container class you have created has a property of margin bottom. Spacings in html pages are of 2 types - paddings and margins. Paddings
                are for alloting spaces inside an html element while margins are for alloting spaces between 2 html elements. The container you have created
                is the outermost div of the page and should therefore contain padding instead of margin.
            </p>
            <p>Always reset default margins and paddings of body and html tags. If a page has padding it will most likely be in the dynamic content. Reset the spaces
                to allow headers and footers to take the full width of the screen.
            </p>
            <p> Understand the structure of my html code and compare it with yours to better understand how you can improve your code.
                As a front-end developer your job is to structure pages properly. While most aren't aware of this and don't care about this, while
                making webpages it is recommended to follow the accessibility and responsive web page principles. These are the principles followed by third-party libraries as well.

            <p>The above code is just another alternate to the method you have approached. Your solution is fine, it's a good
                use of css-grid row and template properties. Using areas is just another alternate method.
